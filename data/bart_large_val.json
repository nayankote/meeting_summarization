The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by. The team then discussed teletext, the target demographic, the buttons the remote should have, the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly, an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost, LCD screens, and language options.\\n\",\"11\":\"For the conceptual design, the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however, they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote, and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. Cases can be flat, single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Hand or kinetic dynamos, batteries, and solar cells can be used as energy sources. Possible interfaces are push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition, in black and yellow, the company colours.\\n\",\"12\":\"The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals.\\n\",\"13\":\"The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black, with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate\\/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features, but still attract their target group, would be to add more colour to the design.

Finally, the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory), leadership and teamwork (happy with it, but they missed communicating in between meetings), and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time, the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). Finally, the decided to call their design Triple-R.\\n\",\"15\":\"The project manager opens the meeting, asking the industrial designer to present first. The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique, such as visibility in the dark, locator alarm, and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact, they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions, explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly, unique design since certain features could be too complex. The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management, which she shares with the group. They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting.\\n\",\"16\":\"The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design, dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs, shock protection, voice recognition, and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group, that the remote is only to control televisions. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip, instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition, would be the most feasible. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints.\\n\"},\"rouge1\":{\"0\":0.5696969697,\"1\":0.3668122271,\"2\":0.4232081911,\"3\":0.5420560748,\"4\":0.5757575758,\"5\":0.4324324324,\"6\":0.5423728814,\"7\":0.4765100671,\"8\":0.3766233766,\"9\":0.5123966942,\"10\":0.5963636364,\"11\":0.4210526316,\"12\":0.2564102564,\"13\":0.4809384164,\"14\":0.4,\"15\":0.5030674847,\"16\":0.4848484848},\"rouge2\":{\"0\":0.262195122,\"1\":0.140969163,\"2\":0.1718213058,\"3\":0.2319749216,\"4\":0.2519083969,\"5\":0.1530054645,\"6\":0.2102272727,\"7\":0.1486486486,\"8\":0.1184210526,\"9\":0.1416666667,\"10\":0.2344322344,\"11\":0.1,\"12\":0.1243523316,\"13\":0.1002949853,\"14\":0.0679886686,\"15\":0.2037037037,\"16\":0.1829268293},\"rougeL\":{\"0\":0.303030303,\"1\":0.2008733624,\"2\":0.2730375427,\"3\":0.261682243,\"4\":0.303030303,\"5\":0.2810810811,\"6\":0.2598870056,\"7\":0.2617449664,\"8\":0.2727272727,\"9\":0.305785124,\"10\":0.3054545455,\"11\":0.1871345029,\"12\":0.2051282051,\"13\":0.2228739003,\"14\":0.2028169014,\"15\":0.2331288344,\"16\":0.2787878788}}"
